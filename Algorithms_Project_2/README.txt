Running the program is very simple.

To use the program all you need is a text file with a set number of points in it. You will need to know how many points are in the file. 
You will run the command:
 amr.exe "hulltype" yourFile
the "hulltype" is specifying what algorithm you would like to use.
Your choices are:
G - Graham Scan
J - Jarvis
Q - Quickhull
yourFile - specifies the file you would like to input. 

The program will output a .txt file with your hull, along with printing to the screen the total time to run the algorithm.
