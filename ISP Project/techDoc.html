	<h2> Contributions </h2>	
	<p align="left"> Each  member  of  the  group  completed  the  same  amount  of  work.  The  features  that  were  added  to  the  site  were  divided  evenly  and  each  group  member  implemented  their  portion.  The  JavaScript  and  CSS  files  were  also  worked  on  simultaneously  to  perfect  the  program. A detailed insight to each member's contribution is shown below.</p>

	<h2> How to Use </h2>
	<p align = "left"> To use the web page generator, add which features you would like using the buttons. Then, you can customize the appearance of the web page, for example font color, size and much more. Now you have added all of your desired features and changed your design, you can drag the features in the design box and create your own preferred design. You can save your progress by setting cookies and returning to the site at a later date to see your progress is still there. The option of clearing cookies is available to use so that you can start over. </p>
	
	<h2> Architecture </h2>
	<p align = "left"> The  project  is  comprised  of  three  files;  an  HTML  file,  CSS  file,  and  a  JavaScript  file.  The  CSS  file  holds  code  that  styles  the  main  website.  The  CSS  file  changes  elements  like  the  website  alignment,  colors,  fonts,  etc.  The  third  and  final  file  is  the  JavaScript  file  which  holds  the  code  that  allows  the  user  to  drag  and  drop  elements  that  were  added  to  their  website, as well as the code for cookies.  The Javascript file  is  the  main  part  of  the  program. </p>
	
	<h2> Business Logic </h2>
	<p align="left"> The user is required to select which feature they would like to be added to their web page. The selection that they make will be the input for the program via button selection. Some of the features require text input from the user. Any decision that the user makes that will affect the program in any way is a from of input to the program. For example, the user may drag their newly formed feature to a new location. This location will have coordinates that the program will have to store and process. Furthermore, the output for the program is the user interface which will is implemented with HTML and CSS. The appearance of the added feature moving across the screen to its new location is also output for the program. These inputs and outputs are required for the program to work. The basic sequence of operations that occur when the program is operated are as follows. First of all, the user should select which feature they would like to add to their web page. This feature will appear on the screen and the user will then drag this new feature to their preferred location. This will be processed using the JavaScript file and the choice of background color, font size/color, and layout is controlled with the HTML file.  </p>
